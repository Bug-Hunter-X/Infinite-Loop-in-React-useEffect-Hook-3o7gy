# React useEffect Infinite Loop Bug

This repository demonstrates a common React bug: an infinite loop caused by improper use of the `useEffect` hook.  The `useEffect` hook is incorrectly designed, leading to a continuous update cycle.  The solution showcases the correct way to manage dependencies within `useEffect` to prevent this issue.  The bug and solution are in separate JavaScript files.
